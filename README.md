The above codes are for the paper "Synthesizing Toffoli-optimal quantum circuits for arbitrary multi-qubit unitaries", by Priyanka Mukhopadhyay.
The implementations are in Python.

Exact_Tof_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing exactly implementable unitaries. It implements EXACT-TOF-OPT and its sub-routines.
RANDOM-CHAN-REP is also implemented here.

Approx_TOF_opt.py : This is the code for synthesizing approximately implementable unitaries. It implements APPROX-TOF-OPT and its sub-routines.
